 * Introduction                  (Made for RPG Maker MZ + RETRO support for MV)
 * ============================================================================
 * Streamline your eventing by creating event bases! Only 1 place to make
 * changes globally! -OR- Need to spawn events (like loot, projectiles etc...)?
 * Then just use "spawn event" commands provided by this plugin!
 * 
 * When event base is copied over target event, this plugin provides 
 * ability to preserve target image. This is optimal for events with same 
 * logic but varying graphics.
 *
 * NOTE: To use preserve img feature ALL images in *event base* must be in
 * SAME charsheet! (Source event may have different charsheet than target 
 * event has, just check that "characterIndexes" follows same logic).
 * Leave target event graphics to "None" to ignore "Preserve image" feature.
 * 
 * All event bases are in memory - always ready to be (ab)used!
 *
 * Event base = Event name in the map dedicated to event bases! This map
 * can be assigned with (Event base map id) plugin parameter.
 * 
 * Event copy pre/post JS (executes when triggered) simply:
 *     Add 2 script commands:
 *         1st is executed before "base" command list
 *         2nd is executed after "base" command list
 *                    
 * This plugin has replaced OcRam_Parallels -plugin!
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Sometimes autorun event is not enough to do the job. Usually these events
 * are erased and will not be called again after menu nor battle scene.
 * And then parallel events are executed in EVERY frame! That is not very
 * efficient way - if task needs to be done only once...
 *
 * If some events needs to be called (refreshed) on scene start (after other
 * scenes like menu/battle) OR... when VARIABLE or SWITCH has been changed -
 * This plugin is Your answer.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * OPTIONAL System #1: EMotions aka. Event Motions (and Emotions)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Used to streamline your eventing:
 *
 *      1. Leave "Face" and "Speaker name" empty and this plugin will autofill
 *         them for you! (Possibility to disable autofill feature "for now" or
 *         temporarily only for next *Show text* command)
 *
 *      2. IF Speaker name is empty, will be filled with [Event Name]
 *
 *      3. IF Face is empty, it will be filled with emotional face.
 *         Example: Character is people1.png and current emotion is
 *         "laugh" then plugin will try to find ./faces/people1_laugh.png
 *         Also character sheet is updated to: people1_laugh.png (if found)
 *         (other examples: Limbing, Sneaking, Cheering etc...)
 *
 *      4. Also can play automated balloon animation to reflect event's
 *         current emotion! (check plugin parameters)
 *
 *      5. SPECIAL CASE: If speaker name is \P[n] or \N[n] will apply
 *         EMotions from this ACTOR instead of EVENT!
 *        
 *      6. Only actor EMotions will persist over transfer/load etc...
 *         Event EMotions are cleared on map transfer! (must be manually
 *         saved and loaded via variables etc...) (but persist over save)
 *
 * - Set EMotions with JS call
 * - You may still use autofill feature, even if emotions are not in use!
 *
 * NOTE: All "Speaker name" features are only available in MZ!
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * OPTIONAL System #2: Pull & Push System
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Make ANY event pullable and/or pushable EASILY with event comments 
 * (event page specific)!
 *
 * KEEP 'OK' button down > when moved towards event = push & move away = pull!
 * With mouse: left button push / middle button pull (3-button mouse required)
 *
 * NOTE: While pushing or pulling player can't activate other events!
 *       If any traps and/or similar events is needed to trigger use parallel
 *       processing (check demo -project for details)!
 *
 * Event position for pullable and/or pushable objects are autosaved!
 * (event._savePosition = false; // will bypass save position method!)
 *
 * TIP: Use Direction fix, stepping and walking animation for various effects!
 *
 *      Example "rolling stones":        Example "statues":
 *      - Direction fix: OFF             - Direction fix: ON
 *      - Walk animation: ON             - Walk animation: OFF
 *      - Stepping: OFF                  - Stepping: OFF
 *
 * TIP: Use *Exit Event Processing* command if you want to do conditioned
 *      pull/push for example must have some special equipment, actor etc...
 *      Also event PAGES can be used for this.
 *
 * // To override some defaults for this event (event page JS)
 * const ev = this.event(); ev._eventMoveSpeed = 3;
 * ev._eventPushEmo = 'push'; ev._eventPullEmo = 'pull';
 * ev._eventMoveBGS = {name:'Quake1',volume:90,pitch:100,pan:0,pos:0};
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * OPTIONAL System #3: Lift, Drop & Throw System
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Make ANY event liftable and throwable (and even breakable/exploding etc...)
 * EASILY with event comments (event page specific)!
 *
 * "Allow region id" plugin parameter allows throw to PASS these region ids 
 * and allows DROP action to drop lifted object off the cliff, bridge etc...
 * (and automatically detects "Underpass region ids" with OcRam_Passages!)
 *
 * "Allow landing" regions will allow throwable items to land on these tiles.
 * Commonly used for tiles like water, lava etc...
 *
 * Event position for liftable and/or throwable objects are autosaved!
 * (event._savePosition = false; // will bypass save position method!)
 *
 * TIP: Use *Exit Event Processing* command if you want to do conditioned
 *      lift/throw for example must have some special equipment, actor etc...
 *      Also event PAGES can be used for this.
 *
 * OK button = lift when lifted Cancel/Menu will put down and OK = THROW!
 * With mouse: Left click = Lift, Middle click = Throw, Right click = Drop
 *
 * // To override some defaults for this event (event page JS)
 * const ev = this.event();
 * ev._eventMoveSpeed = 3;
 * ev._eventLiftEmo = 'sweat';

 * Plugin commands
 * ============================================================================
 * MV example: OcRam_Events/copyEvent Torch 1
 * copyEvent    Copy event from event bases over given event id in current map.
 * >> baseName  Event base to copy.
 * >> eventId   Overwrites this event data with given event base.
 * 
 * MV example: OcRam_Events/spawEvent LootChest [10,14]
 * spawnEvent   Spawn event from event bases to given position.
 * >> baseName  Event base to spawn.
 * >> location  Spawn event to this point.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Event notetags:
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * <event_base:Fire1>   Will copy event base 'Fire1' over this event.
 * <save_position>      Saves event position when ever leaving the map!
 * <parallax>           Fix event to parallax image!
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Event COMMENTS:
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * <force_autofill>  will force autofill feature "ON" while on this event page
 * 
 * <no_autofill>     will force autofill feature "OFF" while on this event page
 *
 * <when_landed>     When event is thrown or dropped from heights and this
 *                   page triggers >> event commands after this comment are
 *                   run instantly and then cleared. Use this to play SE's,
 *                   animations, re-spawns etc...
 *                   
 * To handle parallel events:
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * <run:once>              run parallel event ONCE - in scene start
 *                         (after transfer, menu, battle etc...)
 *
 * <run:onvar:1,2,5>       run parallel event ONCE - if one of the defined
 *                         variables has been changed.
 *
 * <run:onswitch:1,4,76>   run parallel event ONCE - if one of the defined
 *                         switches has been changed.
 *                   
 * IMPORTANT! These comments must be the LAST ROW of the event page:
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * <push>            Creates push system below this comment.
 * <pull>            Creates pull system below this comment.
 * <push&pull>       Creates push & pull system below this comment.
 * <lift:2:A:B>      Creates lift & throw system below this comment and object
 *                   can be thrown 2 tiles + trigger self switch A when landed
 *                   on normal ground and B if landed on "Allow landing region"
 *                   <lift : throw_dist : landed_selfswitch : alt_selfswitch>
 *                   TIP: Use throw distance 0 to create non-throwable object!
 *                   NOTE: "Drop" action won't trigger 'landed_selfswitch'
 *                   UNLES IT'S DROPPED OFF THE CLIFF/BRIDGE etc... MUAHAHHAA!
 *                   alt_selfswitch = Landed on "Allow landing region"
 *
